"""
Resetting Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) typically involves using a specific diagnostic protocol or 
API provided by the ECU (Electronic Control Unit). Since the exact details can vary depending on the ECU and 
the communication protocol used (e.g., OBD-II, UDS, etc.), I'll provide a simple example using a fictional ECU class.

Please note that this is a generic example, and you'll need to adapt it based on the actual protocol and library you 
are using for communication with your ECU.


This example creates a simple ECU class with methods to get and reset Diagnostic Trouble Codes. In a real-world scenario, 
you would replace the simulation with actual communication code using the appropriate library for your ECU and protocol.

Remember to consult the documentation for your specific ECU and communication protocol to understand the correct procedures
for interacting with and resetting DTCs.
